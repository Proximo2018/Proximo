// @note: The BLE DTM 2-wire UART standard specifies 8 data bits, 1 stop bit, no flow control.
//        These parameters are not configurable in the BLE standard.

/**@details Maximum iterations needed in the main loop between stop bit 1st byte and start bit 2nd
 * byte. DTM standard allows 5000us delay between stop bit 1st byte and start bit 2nd byte.
 * As the time is only known when a byte is received, then the time between between stop bit 1st
 * byte and stop bit 2nd byte becomes:
 *      5000us + transmission time of 2nd byte.
 *
 * Byte transmission time is (Baud rate of 19200):
 *      10bits * 1/19200 = approx. 520 us/byte (8 data bits + start & stop bit).
 *
 * Loop time on polling UART register for received byte is defined in ble_dtm.c as:
 *   UART_POLL_CYCLE = 260 us
 *
 * The max time between two bytes thus becomes (loop time: 260us / iteration):
 *      (5000us + 520us) / 260us / iteration = 21.2 iterations.
 *
 * This is rounded down to 21.
 *
 * @note If UART bit rate is changed, this value should be recalculated as well.
